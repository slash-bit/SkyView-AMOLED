SkyView is a traffic awareness device. It displays air traffic received through EC radio device such as SoftRF  and shows provided FLARM NMEA or Garmin GDL90 data on the screen.

It is best suited to operate as a companion device for SoftRF hardware and it helps to visualize nearby traffic in a user friendly manner. It was also reported by builders that it operates with SkyEcho, Stratux and PilotAware as well.

Data input is accepted over:

"classic" serial interface ;
Wi-Fi UDP connection ;
Bluetooth SPP ;
Bluetooth LE

This repository is based on fork from Mosche Branner's version of SkyView and it sports some nice additions on top of original SkyView.
My version is ported to PlatformIO - the tool of choice for building and compiling for various devices and screens.
The firmware currently supports e-Paper screens, but will be also expanded to bright IPS based TFT colour screens .
